# Backbone Very Basic Demo

Extremely basic example of a Backbone View.

I threw in Require.js and Handlebars-based templating because I felt like it, but you absolutely don't
have to use those if you don't want.

## Getting Started

To start building the code, run:

```
sudo npm install -g bower gulp
npm install
bower install
```

You can use gulp to open the main page in a browser, and automatically reload anytime something is changed:

```
gulp
```
